      <p class="description">
        I’m from Punjab, India. Currently I’m studying computer programming
        course at Georgian College on the Toronto campus. As i have great
        interest in Cyber Security so my main goal is to focus on this course.
        Basically Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer
        systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It involves
        implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
        other cyber threats. This field encompasses various technologies,
        processes, and practices aimed at safeguarding information and ensuring
        the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.
